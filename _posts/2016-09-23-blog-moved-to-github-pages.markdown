I almost deleted my blog, for several reasons:

- Pretty much anything I might write could be found on [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com).
- Posts take time, which is why I have so few, and time is valuable.
- Hosting it isn't free - even though it is a small amount, it's hard to justify.
- Wordpress - I should have said this one first...

I decided against it, and ended up moving the blog to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). My reasons were the following:

- Free
- No more Wordpress
- No more db
- Faster
- Got to play around with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static-site generator, which incidentally is what github pages is powered by.
