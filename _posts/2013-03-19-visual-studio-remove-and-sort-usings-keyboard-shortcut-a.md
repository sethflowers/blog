I like clean code. When I work in C#, that includes sorting my using statements, as well as removing unused using statements. It has been a habit of mine for a while now, that whenever I reference a new type that requires a new using statement in a file, I automatically type "ALT e i o a" to invoke the "Remove and Sort" menu. It looks a little long, but pound it into your head; it is very easy to type.

Update - In Visual Studio 2017, it is now even shorter - "ALT e i e"
